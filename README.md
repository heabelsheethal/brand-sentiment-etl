# brand-sentiment-etl

An **automated ETL pipeline** for **brand sentiment analysis** from news articles, powered by:
- **MongoDB** → Storing cleaned article data  
- **Neo4j** → Modeling brand–keyword relationships as graphs  
- **Flask** → Serving an interactive dashboard visualization for results  

This project demonstrates **data engineering, NLP, and visualization skills** by integrating multiple technologies into a production-style pipeline.

## Problem Statement

Marketing teams need to assess **brand reputation** by analyzing how brands are mentioned in the media.  
Manually tracking online mentions, sentiment, and brand associations is **time-consuming** and **error-prone**.  

This project solves the problem by:
- Automating **extraction → transformation → loading (ETL)** of news articles  
- Running **sentiment analysis and keyword extraction**  
- Building a **graph database** to capture brand–keyword associations  
- Serving results through a **visual dashboard**

    A[News Articles Dataset] --> B[Extract & Preprocess]
    B --> C[MongoDB Storage]
    C --> D[Sentiment Analysis + Keyword Extraction]
    D --> E[Neo4j Graph Database]
    E --> F[Flask Dashboard]

Steps
1. Extract

Input: News articles dataset (nyt_articles_subset.parquet).

Sources can be extended to APIs (NewsAPI, GDELT, RSS feeds).

2. Transform

Clean and normalize text.

Run sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral).

Extract brands & adjectives.

3. Load

Store structured articles in MongoDB.

Insert brand–keyword relationships into Neo4j.

4. Visualize

Serve results in Flask dashboard.

Charts: brand mentions trend, adjectives bar chart, word clouds, Neo4j graph.

📊 Dashboard Features
1. Brand Mentions Over Time

Line chart showing how often a brand appears in articles over time.

Helps detect sudden spikes (e.g., Adidas during World Cup).

2. Top Adjectives per Brand

Bar chart of adjectives describing the brand.

Reveals whether the tone is positive, neutral, or negative.

3. Word Cloud

Highlights the most frequent adjectives associated with the brand.

4. Graph Visualization

Neo4j-powered graph of brands and related keywords.
